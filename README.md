# Flip-Dot Display Based Clock
# Goals
The main goal of the project is to make use of a 7 rows x 17 collumns flip-dot display through displaying self-made clock on STM32G0 series STM on it.
There are also a few minor things that can be achieved along the way:<br/>
a): Desinging STM32 based logic with peripherals associeted to it (UART and two I2C buses, USB C, external oscilator and 3 port expanders) <br/>
b): Using transistors in order to controll relatively large voltages using STM32 associated logic. (12V that will be used to power the flip-dot display controlling matrix)<br/>
c): Developing a STM32 alghoritm in order to make a real time clock and a way to show it on a display.<br/>
# Implementation
The detailed descripction is available in the project's documentation.
